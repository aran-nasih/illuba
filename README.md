# Getting started

In root directory run
```npm install``` <hr/>
in client directory run
```npm install``` as well

Start Express on port 3001 as React normally starts on 3000
```PORT=3001 node server/www```
or use nodemon for auto restart server after saving
```PORT=3001 nodemon server/www```

Finally start React, in client directory run
```npm start```

Please look at [this repository](https://github.com/aran-nasih/react-express-mongodb) for more info on how it works and deployment.
