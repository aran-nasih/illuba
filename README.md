# Getting started

1. In root directory run
```npm install```
<br/>
2. In client directory run
```npm install``` as well
<br/>
<br/>
3. Start Express on port 3001 as React normally starts on 3000
<br/>
4. Run this command in root directory
```PORT=3001 node server/www```
<br/>
* oO use nodemon for auto restart server after saving
```PORT=3001 nodemon server/www```
